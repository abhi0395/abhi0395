# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there â€” I'm Abhijeet Anand!

I'm an **astrophysicist and data scientist** at [**Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL)**](https://www.lbl.gov), working with the [**Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)**](https://www.desi.lbl.gov/) collaboration. As a core member of DESI's data systems, management, and science teams, I explore the cosmos using one of the most ambitious and extensive spectroscopic surveys to date.

## What I Do

- Analyze massive spectroscopic datasets of galaxies and quasars from surveys like **DESI**
- Develop **efficient, scalable algorithms** for:
  - Spectral reduction and continuum fitting
  - Modeling galaxy spectra and redshift estimation
  - Statistical inference and physical interpretation
- Combine **machine learning** (PCA, NMF, regression, statistical learning) with physical models
- Work in Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Bash scripting; experienced with **HPC**, **Slurm**, and **GPU clusters**
- Study the **formation and evolution of galaxies** through emission and absorption features

## Open to Collaborations

I'm always excited to collaborate on **data science** and **astronomy** projects â€” whether academic or applied. I'm particularly interested in cross-disciplinary work where physical modeling meets statistical learning.
