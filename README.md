### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Nice to meet you!

- ðŸ”­ I'm an astrophysicist working with the [Dark Energy Survey Instrument (DESI)](https://www.desi.lbl.gov/) collaboration at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. I am a core DESI data system, management, and galaxy quasar science group member. 
- ðŸŒ± I work with large astronomical datasets, especially images and spectra, to extract physical properties that can offer insights into these gas flows around galaxies. I am also deeply interested in developing efficient and optimized algorithms and tools to analyze astronomical datasets and perform statistical studies, particularly spectral reduction, modelling galaxy spectra and measuring their distances/redshifts. I use a combination of machine learning algorithms (such as PCA, NMF, regression, and statistical learning) and physical models to perform detailed studies of astronomical data sets.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data science-related projects in real life and would like to learn more from the community.
- ðŸŒ± I also write a lot of code (mostly in Python and jupyter notebooks, though I do bash scripting sometimes for my work). I have experience working with HPC systems, slurm job manager, cron jobs and GPUs (though I am a beginner at it now).
